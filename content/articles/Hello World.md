#### Hello World. This is where it all begins. 



This is a place for me to think out loud.

I’ve come to realize that thought and discussion are limited in their ability to foster a holistic understanding of a topic. They can easily be lead astray because they are prone to distraction and lack structure. It can be hard to understand how you came to adopt a certain belief or perspective, or how you learned a concept. Was it something someone told you that you just took at face value? Or did it come from a persuasive argument? How long have you held this belief? What are the facts and assumptions underlying it? Under what circumstances should you reconsider it? In my experience, most people seldom ask themselves questions like these. I think the chief reason for this is that thinking and conversation are ill-suited for this type of introspection. To truly understand a topic, and then develop a holistic position on it, you need a way to anchor your reasoning.  

There is no better way to do this than writing.

It forces you to structure your thinking and strip away irrelevant or superfluous information to really get at the core of the topic you’re seeking to understand. There’s no hiding from the words you put on a page. And if you sit down to write about a certain topic and find yourself struggling to articulate your thoughts, it could be a sign you need to spend some more time learning about it. Writing regularly is the only way to sharpen your critical thinking skills.

So that’s why I write.

I use three principles to help me decide what I write about:

I write to think, not to build an audience.
I enjoy taking my time with a topic and go as deep as I feel, even if it means publishing late.
I’m writing for the long term. I want my posts to feel relevant for years, which means I will mostly focus on ideas instead of commenting on trends.
