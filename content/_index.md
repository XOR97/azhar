## Hi. I‚Äôm Azhar.

I use this space to pen my thoughts on topics that are at the intersection of Data Engineering, Product Management, Design & User Experience.

Currently my postion vector points to üá®üá¶, where I'm trying to get my master's degree in Engineering Management from the [University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/en). Most recently, I have worked as a Data Engineer at [RateGain](https://rategain.com). I was part of the Data Science Lab and Product team there and worked on a diverse set of problems ranging from price optimizations techniques, sentiment analysis of reviews to building custom algorithms for city demand forecasting. Prior to that, I was an undergraduate at [Jamia Hamdard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamia_Hamdard) in New Delhi, where I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

I write [articles on code and design](/articles/). I also keep [notes on things I‚Äôm learning](/notes/) from books, courses and talks.

Most of my experience has been focused on the design & growth of analytic-driven systems and managing their scale. Usually, that means bouncing between research, feature design/development, growth analysis, and team coordination. Like to use new products and give feedback. Always on the lookout for amalgamation of beautiful design and great technology in solving everyday problems.

Love working on tools, infrastructure and scaling applications from the ground up. Heavily reliant on [Python](https://www.python.org) to get me out of trouble but sometimes also program in [Go](https://golang.org) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org). I'm also an opensource contributor and my current favorite projects are [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) & [Bisq](https://bisq.network/).

When not writing code or building design prototypes, I can be found playing football (soccer if you may), following the [Champions League](https://www.uefa.com) and backpacking across the üåç. An avid quizzer who occasionally brags about random trivia that no one seems to care. The [Clippers](https://www.nba.com/clippers/) üèÄ are my team. Can cook up a really hybrid version of Aglio E Olio. Also have a weak spot for [Samosas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samosa).

###### P.S. I use [Atom](https://atom.io).

## Where to go next

You can find out [what I'm up to right now](/now/). Alternatively, take a look at a few [things I‚Äôve made](/things/) to get a bit more idea of my experience.
