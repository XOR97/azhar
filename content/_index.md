## Hi. Iâ€™m Azhar.

I use this *space* to pen my thoughts on a range of topics that are at the intersection of Computer Science, Data Engineering, Product Design & Development.

Currently I live in Ottawa, where I'm trying to get my master's degree in Engineering Management from the [University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/en). Previously, I have worked as a Data Engineer at [RateGain](https://rategain.com). I was part of the Data Science Lab  and Product team there and worked on a diverse set of problems ranging from price optimizations techniques, sentiment analysis of reviews to building custom algorithms for city demand forecasting. Prior to that, I was an undergraduate at [Jamia Hamdard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamia_Hamdard) in New Delhi, where I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

I write [articles on code and design](/articles/). I also keep [notes on things Iâ€™m learning](/notes/) from books, courses and talks.

Most of my experience has been focused on the design & growth of analytic-driven systems and managing their scale. Usually, that means bouncing between research, feature design/development, growth analysis, and team coordination.

Love working on tools, infrastructure and scaling applications from the ground up. Heavily reliant on [Python](https://www.python.org) to get me out of trouble but sometimes also program in [Go](https://golang.org) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org). I'm also an opensource contributor and my current favorite projects are [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) & [Coala](https://coala.io/).

When not writing code, I can be found playing football (soccer if you may), following the [Champions League](https://www.uefa.com), backpacking across Canada and outside of it once in a while. An avid quizzer who occasionally brags about random trivia that no one seems to care. Have a weak spot for good music.

PS -  I use [Atom](https://atom.io).

## Where to go next

You can find out [what I'm up to right now](/now/). Alternatively, take a look at [my CV](https://example.com) to get a bit more idea of my experience.

Iâ€™m currently working on a [projects](/projects/) page, to case study some of my work, but itâ€™s taking a while. In the meantime check out a few [things Iâ€™ve made](/things/).
