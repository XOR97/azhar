## Hi. Iâ€™m Azhar.

I use this space to pen my thoughts on topics that are at the intersection of Technology, Data (Engineering + Viz) & sometimes Product Design.

My position vector points to ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦, where I'm working in the Data Management team at [Ottawa Public Health](https://www.ottawapublichealth.ca/en/index.aspx). I quite recently acquired a master's degree in Engineering Management from the [University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/en). I have worked in both data and product teams at [RateGain](https://rategain.com), solving problems ranging from price optimizations, sentiment analysis of customer reviews to building algorithms for city demand forecasting. Before that, I was an undergrad at [Jamia Hamdard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamia_Hamdard) in New Delhi, where I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

I write [articles on code and design](/articles/). I also keep [notes on things Iâ€™m learning](/notes/) from books, courses and talks.

Most of my experience has focused on the design & growth of information systems and managing their scale. Usually, that means bouncing between research, feature design/development, growth analysis, and team coordination. I like to use new products and give feedback. Always on the lookout for amalgamation of beautiful design and great technology in solving everyday problems.

I love working on tools, infrastructure and scaling applications from the ground up. I pick up the language(s)/tool(s) which make the most sense for the task at hand, but I'm most comfortable with [Python](https://www.python.org) to get me out of trouble and occasionally also code in [Go](https://golang.org) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org). Iâ€™m also an active open-source contributor and community member. Current favourite projects include [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega) & [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org).

When not writing code or creating viz charts, you can find me playing football (soccer if you may), watching the [Champions League](https://www.uefa.com) highlights reel or wandering off to Mount Royal Park in MontrÃ©al. An avid quizzer who occasionally brags about random trivia. I closely follow the [Warriors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors). Love cooking Aglio e Olio twice a week. Also, have a weak spot for Uncle Tetsu's [Cheesecake](https://uncletetsu-ca.com). 

Audentes Fortuna Iuvat.

###### P.S. I use [Atom](https://atom.io).

## Where to go next

You can find out [what I'm up to right now](/now/). Alternatively, take a look at a few [things Iâ€™ve made](/things/) to get a bit more idea of my experience.
