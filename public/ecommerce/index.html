        <section class="PostBody">
          <p>This page briefly explains how I approach designing and building an eCommerce website, how much it costs and how long it takes.</p>
<p>This should give you an idea of whether I&rsquo;m the right person to design and build your new website and help you start selling products online.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-process">About the process</h2>
<p>Essentially, what we’ll be doing is designing and building a bespoke website which represents your brand and meets your expectations.</p>
<p>First we’ll discuss the requirements for the website, then set the goals for the project. From here we’ll explore design ideas and decide the appropriate direction to take. Then I’ll work on some designs based on our discussion and decisions.</p>
<p>Once you’re happy with the design and any required revisions have been made, I’ll build the design in code, and add initial content so we’re ready to test before launch.</p>
<p>We’ll keep the project as dynamic and fluid as possible, and stay in regular contact throughout the process.</p>
<p>When it comes to building your website, behind the design and code your shop will be powered by a popular eCommerce solution called Shopify.</p>
<h2 id="about-shopify">About Shopify</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a> takes care of the difficult parts of eCommerce – such as taking payments, managing orders and tracking product inventory.</p>
<p>Using Shopify makes it much faster and more affordable to get up and running selling products online via your own website.</p>
<p>The platform has excellent support and a whole host of integrations to extend the functionality of your website, should you want to add custom features or wish to scale in the future.</p>
<p>Basically, Shopify is a great product that’s trusted by lots of businesses.</p>
<h2 id="shopify-fees">Shopify fees</h2>
<p>It’s important to make you aware that Shopify charge a monthly subscription fee. Shopify’s Basic package is <code>$29/month</code> and this is usually more than sufficient for most small businesses.</p>
<p>The Basic package price includes hosting your website, unlimited products, 24/7 support, and allows you to assign inventory to up to 4 physical shop locations.</p>
<p>Shopify also charges a small fee of around 2.0% for online credit card payments.</p>
<p>You can find more information about Shopify’s fees <a href="https://www.shopify.co.uk/pricing">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="previous-project">Previous project</h2>
<p>To give you an idea of how your eCommerce website might function, I previously designed a Shopify powered website for <a href="https://www.albioncycling.com/">albioncycling.com</a>.</p>
<p>For a detailed look at my process for this project, you can find a case study here: <a href="https://harrycresswell.com/projects/albion/">Albioncycling.com case study</a>.</p>
<h2 id="client-testimonials">Client testimonials</h2>
<p>Here are a couple of testimonials in case you’re interested to read what a few of my previous clients have to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Harry manages to at once meet seriously impressive digital skills with a great eye for design and an attention to detail that can satisfy even a client with OCD&hellip;Nothing is ever too much trouble.”
– Rose Beer @ Rose Beer Beauty.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Harry and Luke were a pleasure to work with from start to finish. Creative in their ideas and highly efficient in their execution, they are a formidable partnership. Our website and online store brief presented Harry and Luke with a number of creative and technical challenges, which they solved with aplomb and with minimum fuss.” – Charlie Stewart @ Albion Cycling.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-i-charge">What I charge</h2>
<p>To keep things simple, I charge a flat fee of <strong>£1500</strong> to design and build an eCommerce website.</p>
<p>I request a <strong>50% payment upfront</strong> to make sure we’re both committed to the project, and <strong>50% on completion</strong>. I only request the final payment once you’ve confirmed you’re happy with the final outcome.</p>
<p>This fee covers any technical help you may need to get up and running, including guidance using Shopify’s content management system to manage your products and process orders.</p>
<p>This price won’t change and there won’t be any other hidden costs involved. However, if you require content creation such as copywriting or photography, this can be discussed at an additional cost.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-it-takes">How long it takes</h2>
<p><strong>2-3 weeks</strong> should be more than enough time to design and build the website, however I usually allow <strong>4 weeks</strong> as a buffer, just in case there are any issues or setbacks during the process.</p>
<p>This timeframe is largely dependent on how far along you are with the content for the website, and how clear you are about what you want to achieve from the project.</p>
<p>Creating content for a website is often the most time-consuming part. This includes writing copy for pages (about page, delivery and returns, privacy policy, etc), photographing products and organising initial imagery for launch.</p>
<p>If you already have content for you website that’s great, we should be able to complete the project within this timeframe.</p>
<p>If you haven’t even thought about content yet, or only have some, then not to worry.
We can discuss the best direction to take before getting the project underway.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>If this sounds good and you’re happy with my approach, then please fill out the project planner via the link below.</p>
<p><a href="https://harrycresswell.typeform.com/to/JlvvVS">eCommerce Website Project Planner</a></p>
<p>The aim of the project planner is to get a better understanding of what stage you’re currently at with the planning of your website, and what’s required from the project. This will help make sure we’re both on the same page before we begin.</p>
<p>Following this we can jump on a call to discuss the project in more detail and identify any specific requirements. Then, if all is well we can get the project underway.</p>
