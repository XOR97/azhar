        <title>The just ‘show up every day’ conundrum</title>

        <description>&lt;p class=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;
    You often read that the best way to make progress and achieve your goals is to just show up every day and put in the hours.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re working towards writing a book, running a marathon or something else, it works the same, regardless of your goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success is largely based on repetition. It’s the result of what you choose to commit to and practice on a regular basis. It’s the total sum of your habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Show up every day&lt;/em&gt; is generally very good advice, but often it leaves me feeling like I want more from it. Let me explain what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you read about the importance of ‘showing up every day’, rarely do you read on to discover any actionable advice to help you make it happen. You’re just told that you need to ‘show up’, if you want to succeed. But like most things, showing up is easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, by saying ‘just show up every day’ you’re not offering any practical solutions to help whoever you’re advising make progress with variety of different commitments. It offers no framework to ensure you make progress in equal measures. And this is what I find myself searching for more than anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So these are my questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if I want to write a book and run a marathon?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if I have client commitments and side projects?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if there are courses I want to take?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if I have financial goals too?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And, what if there’s more still, that I’m working towards?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I stay committed to each and every one of these things, and invest my time in equal measures?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s lots we all want to achieve with the time we have each day, and not enough is written about the strategies to help us get there. Strategies that can help us manage a whole range of commitments without feeling overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://azharkhan.in/articles/implementation-intentions/&#34;&gt;Staying committed&lt;/a&gt; isn’t always easy. The more you take on, the harder it becomes to prioritise your commitments and juggle your time. It’s like having too many tabs open in your browser. The more you have open, the harder it becomes to make decisions and focus on your next actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to procrastination. You struggle to make progress. You end up focusing your energy on all the wrong things, or you give more attention to one project over another. In some cases you loose sight of your &lt;a href=&#34;https://azharkhan.in/articles/intentions-2020/&#34;&gt;intentions&lt;/a&gt; entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you continue to read the same old advice; if you want to to reach your goals you must &lt;em&gt;show up every day&lt;/em&gt; and consistently put in the work. And that seems to be the extent of it. I’m not saying this is bad advice. Quite the opposite, in fact. But without any practical guidance on how to actually ‘show up’, this advice isn’t particularly helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve written previously about how &lt;a href=&#34;https://azharkhan.in/articles/implementation-intentions/&#34;&gt;implementation intentions&lt;/a&gt; can help you stick with your commitments. The formula it provides, works by applying situational cues to a specific commitment. But, now I’m looking for a strategy that helps apply this formula to a variety of commitments, rather than treating each commitment independently. Think &lt;a href=&#34;https://jamesclear.com/habit-stacking&#34;&gt;habit stacking&lt;/a&gt;, if it helps you make sense of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need a solid framework to help achieve these things. A solution that helps you show up daily and make progress towards all of your goals, not just one. A method you can apply to your process, that helps you prioritise your schedule and structure your days to make the most of your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all want to get the most out of the time we have available. And we’re all trying our best to manage a variety commitments, which in most cases we’d like to stay committed to. But the hardest part is just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So rather than relying on the just &lt;em&gt;show up every day&lt;/em&gt; conundrum, and calling it our best advice. We should think more about the strategies we can use to turn this advice into something more actionable. And look for a better approach to help manage our commitments, that ensures we make balanced progress, day after day.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Expert and beginner</title>
        <link>https://azharkhan.in/articles/expert-beginner/</link>

        <description>&lt;p class=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;
    Recently, my girlfriend showed me a new way to make responsive grids without media queries. The technique uses repeat, auto-fit and min-max and until that point I wasn’t aware of it. Rebekka’s only been coding for a few months, but she’s already teaching me so much that I don’t already know. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What excites me most about building things for the web is that it’s constantly evolving and because of this, we’re continuously learning new methods. It seems like every day there’s an exciting new way of doing something and it’s almost always an improvement on the techniques we know or that we’ve relied on for years. At times you find yourself learning these techniques from someone just starting out. Someone you might think of as a beginner. But regardless of their inexperience, you can guarantee they know something you don’t. Just as they might be keen to learn from you, you can learn something just as valuable from them, becoming a better developer in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachel Andrew summed this up perfectly in &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rachelandrew/status/1096807596462403584&#34;&gt;a recent tweet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I love that in this industry you get to be an expert and a beginner at the same time. Learning new things, being a beginner, reminds me what that is like and makes me a better teacher of the things I am expert in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constant need to learn and start over can feel overwhelming at times, we all feel it, regardless of our experience or lack there of. It’s the way we frame our mindset and approach our work which is the most important thing to master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people let it get to them, becoming despondent with their attitude and outdated in their approach. They form what you might call a ‘fixed‘ mindset, preventing themselves from developing further. Others choose to grow, seeing this as an exciting opportunity. They embrace the attitude of a life long learner and learn continuously from whoever they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As so-called inexperienced developers it’s important to value what little we may know. Be confident knowing that though we may refer to ourselves as beginners, we are in fact experts alike. We have something just as important to teach as we have to learn, regardless of how long we’ve been building things for the web. The vastness and complexity of this industry means it’s impossible know it all. There’s a very good chance what we choose to focus on is different to that of our more experienced co-worker. We must use this to our advantage every way we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have read Frank Chimero’s seminal article &lt;a href=&#34;https://frankchimero.com/writing/everything-easy-is-hard-again/%7C&#34;&gt;Everything easy is hard again&lt;/a&gt; in which he says;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”In one way, it is easier to be inexperienced: you don’t have to learn what is no longer relevant. Experience, on the other hand, creates two distinct struggles: the first is to identify and unlearn what is no longer necessary (that’s work, too). The second is to remain open-minded, patient, and willing to engage with what’s new, even if it resembles a new take on something you decided against a long time ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As experienced developers we must maintain the desire to learn and reinvent. We must listen and keep an open-mind about who we learn from. Learning from those just starting out can help us to embrace &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin&#34;&gt;Shoshin&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise know as ‘Beginners Mind‘. Whilst teaching can help us remain humble, learn patience and let go of our preconceptions. As we teach something new, we learn to approach each problem as if it was for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how much we think we know, we must never think we know it all or believe we are better, simple because we‘ve been doing it longer. We cannot afford to be precious about what we know. Holding on makes it harder to let go. We must be challenge our techniques when challenged and questioning when the time is right to reinvent our methods. Doing so will help us to unlearn what is no longer necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting to me is that after all these years many of us are no closer to figuring out which group we fit in. Are we experts or are we beginners? We may think of ourselves as experts in many areas, but we’re beginners in countless others. We are in fact all experts &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; beginners and whilst this medium continues to evolve (which it will) this will always be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So by valuing the teachings experts and beginners alike and embracing the idea that we too are an expert and a beginner, we become better developers. You might go as far as to say that this willing and open-minded approach is fundamental in making a great developer.&lt;/p&gt;
